# SMU-Capstone-Soccer
This is the repository for research of analytics on Southern Methodist University Soccer Team Spatial data. The files and notebook are authored by Thomas Karba for the Capstone project. The notebook is the product of research and countless hours spent to create a working metric by which to analyze the Season's Games. The final deliverable for the class was the research paper which describes the process. And for the coach of SMU Men's Soccer, a csv was created that can be cross referenced to video of games with metric values for each possession. The metric is the Expected Contribution to the Outcome of Match, and it was inspired by research done by a team of data scientists in Europe, lead by Brensen. I made changes to the process, or gave my interpretation of the metric to fit our problem. The metric is a success and can be used to analyze spatial data for soccer teams.
